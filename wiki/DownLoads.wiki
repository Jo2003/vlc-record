= No more Downloads on Google Code =
Google Code has *deprecated* downloads. Therefore I put all new files
on Google Drive and added a (more or less) nice site that lists all current downloads.



== Downloads ==
  * [http://rt.coujo.de/downloads/dwnld.php?ver=current Current Downloads]
  * [http://rt.coujo.de/downloads/dwnld.php All Downloads since Version 2.64]
  * [https://code.google.com/p/vlc-record/downloads/list?can=4 All older Downloads]
